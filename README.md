# Odin - Calculator

## An on-screen calculator

This project is a part of The Odin Project Foundations Course (JavaScript Basics). It is the final project that combines everything I have learned so far (JavaScript, HTML, and CSS). This project shows how to do the following:
 
 * Create basic math functions: add, subtract, multiply, divide
 * Develop an `operate` function to execute operations based on the operator and two numbers
 * Design an HTML calculator with buttons for digits, basic functions, and an "equals" key
 * Include a display for the calculator
 * Ensure the calculator evaluates only one pair of numbers at a time
 * Preven answers with long decimals from screen overflow
 * Provide support decimal input with a "." button
